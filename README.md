# About the Project

This is an attempt to design a laser cut Eurorack mini-case with USB power, which is itself also modular. It comes out of my experiments with 3D printed RackBlox. I like the modular aspect of the RackBlox design and the fact the each module had it own case that then interlocks with others, but the housing often broken after just a few uses and I found the redesign and printing process tedious, as some of my modules were none standard widths (i.e. 21HP). 

The aim is to create a fully parametricised 3D model in Fusion, so that a case can be printed for any module width, just by changing a single parameter.

The plam is to use a mortise and tenon system to make snap together joints than are strong enough but can easily be taken apart

# TODO

- Make the case deeper to accomodate at least a 50mm module (typically skiff depth)
	- tenon part can stay the same depth
- Cut a peg for the mortice and tenon system to make it even studier
- Find a way to connect modules horizontally
	- two mortice and tenons on each side that connect to the central tenon part
- Adjust the tenon part to be half the depth
- The tenon piece could also be horizontal, for better cable access
	- but then i lose my system for connecting modules horizontally
- Better system for screws
	 - normal eurorack thread size in 3mm, this means we would have to use 6mm for our wood thickness
	 - currently screws split the MDF. Could predrill holes, but after a few dismantling the screws would stop working
- How/where to mount the usbpowerthingy?
